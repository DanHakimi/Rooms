====================

Accomplished this week

-------------------

* Continuing fleshing out data model
* Barebones UI

Pitch
-----

We are building a system for managing registrations of rooms on campus.  It is
a significant improvement over the existing system because it has a simplified
workflow, and better organizational qualities for administrators.
