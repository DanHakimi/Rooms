====================

What we did
-----------

* Documentation is automatically placed online with every commit.
* Created a document that describes setting up a development environment.
* Started on the design skeleton.

Scary things
------------

* No sign of Curtis.
* The SysAdmins arenâ€™t willing to sustain a Django project long term.
* Dan likes to make quick, small tweaks. This does not work very smoothly with
  the commit/push/pull/build pattern. Alex has a plan for this. Also, there
  might be some lighter tweaks happening in the Chrome Dev Tools.

Plan for Next Week
------------------

* Flesh out the design skeleton some more.
* Find out what happened to Curtis.
* Finish data model (including figuring out GIS stuff)
* Write that pitch
