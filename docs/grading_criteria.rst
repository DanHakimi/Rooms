Grading Criteria
================

We have not agreed to any final grading criteria as a group, however our
current ideas are:

* Group participation
* Getting work done, both in terms of programming as well as any other tasks
  that are a part of the project.
* Communication.

Timeliness is a portion of all of these metrics.
