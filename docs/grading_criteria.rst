Grading Criteria
================

We have not agreed to any final grading criteria as a group, however our
current ideas are:

* Participation in group meetings.

  * Full credit: Attended most meetings and participated in them.
  * 3/4 credit: Attended most meetings and was sometimes involved.
  * Half credit: Attended some to most meetings and was sometimes involved.
  * 1/4 credit: Attended a few meetings, was rarely involved.
  * No credit: Missed almost all meetings or was rarely involved.
* Getting work done, both in terms of programming as well as any other tasks
  that are a part of the project.

  * Full credit: Completed almost all work, well.
  * 3/4 credit: Completed most of their work, in an adequate fashion.
  * Half credit: Completed some of their work, in a mediocre fashion.
  * 1/4 credit: Rarely completed their work, in a sub-standard fashion.
  * No credit: Almost never completed their work, or was of very poor quality.
* Worked with other team members.

  * Full credit: Assisted other teammates, and worked with them on shared tasks.
  * No credit: Didn't help other teammates, or failed to contributed to shared
    tasks.
* Communication.

  * Full credit: Let teammates know of their current status.
  * No credit: Failed to inform teammates of their progress on milestones, or
    e.g. missed meetings.

Timeliness is a portion of all of these metrics.
