Persona
=======

One example user of our application is Charles Xavier, who is a senior and a
philosophy major and president of the cognitive sciences club. He spends lots
of time in the Union and need to arrange for their club to hold meetings there
on occasion. He doesn't have a fixed schedule, and needs the ability to
register a room in a quick and easy process.

His goals for our application are:

* To see when rooms are available.
* To register a room.
* To verify that their registration was approved.
* To see what other organizations are meeting on a given night, to avoid
  conflicts.
* To not need a ton of information to reserve a room, and for it to be a
  single-step process.
